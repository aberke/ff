### Data 

See `data/`

Data were collected from 2 main sources:
1. Field studies conducted through RSVP forms. See `ml-surveys/`.
The field studies were conducted through Google Forms and the data went to spreadsheets. The aggregated and deidentified dataset is provided and used in the analysis notebooks.

2. An online survey conducted through Qualtrics where participants were recruited via the Prolific platform.
Online survey data is preprocessed to remove identifying information (participant Prolific IDs). The resulting dataset is made openly accessible.

All data collection was approved via the MIT IRB.

The primary use of the data is to study the impact of vegetarian/vegan labels on food selection.

A secondary use of the data is to analyze the dietary habits and preferences of the surveyed population and estimate the average days/week the population eats vegetarian/vegan. This secondary analysis also makes use of census data from the ACS 5-year survey. This dataset is also provided in `data/`
